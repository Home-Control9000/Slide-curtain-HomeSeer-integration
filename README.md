# Slide-curtain-HomeSeer-integration

I bought a Slide smart WIFI curtain by this Dutch company: https://nl.slide.store/
You can control it with a APP on Android an IOS (iPhone)
This is done with a Cloud connection which is working well but i needede local control becaise this is much more reliable and faster.

The guys from Slide build a local API.
