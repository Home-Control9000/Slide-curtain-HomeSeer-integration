# Slide-curtain-HomeSeer-integration

I bought a Slide smart WIFI curtain by this Dutch company: https://nl.slide.store/
You can control it with a APP on Android and IOS (iPhone) devices.
This is done with a Cloud connection which is working well but i needed local control because this is more reliable and faster.

The guys from Slide build a local API. 
You can activate it by request joining the Slide Beta Program by sending a E-mail to support@slide.store:
You will receive a 'Getting started document and some Postma JSON examples
